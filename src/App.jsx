                Digital tools have transformed the way we live, work, and
                connect. They make life easier, more efficient, and more
                accessible. But as we’ve optimised for convenience and
                engagement, we’ve overlooked an essential factor: balance.

                For years, UX design has been driven by the pursuit of
                engagement—crafting interfaces that capture attention, optimise
                time spent, and increase user retention. However, many of these
                strategies have been built on behavioural patterns designed to
                maximise profit at the expense of user well-being. Dark
                patterns, endless scroll, and algorithm-driven engagement loops
                have subtly conditioned consumers to spend more—more money, more
                time, more attention, more data.
